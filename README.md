##Poker Hand
###Description
This code, utilizing testing and refactoring, takes an array of cards (represented by letters and number)
as an argument and returns the poker hand the cards represent.  This is still a work in progress, 
but with significant refactoring is on its way to complete.  Please open poker.rb in the terminal.
